ERROR in Kmer3 parameters
Run with the following parameters:
kmer3 [-t min|max] <file1.prf> <file2.prf> [ ... <filen.prf>]

Parameters:
-t min | -t max: search for minimun distances or maximum distances (-t min by default)
<file1.prf>: source profile file for computing distances
<file2.prf> [ ... <filen.prf>]: target profile files for computing distances

This program computes the distance from profile <file1.prf> to the rest
